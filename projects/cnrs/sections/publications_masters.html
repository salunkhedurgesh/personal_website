                Parallel manipulators are being used extensively to cater to the needs of a multitude of
                industrial
                automation applications. Due to its kinematic accuracy and structural stiffness, parallel
                manipulators have
                proven considerable advantage over their serial counterparts. In modern applications, humans
                train,
                collaborate and interact with the manipulators in order to maximize the productivity and the
                quality of the
                final product. The critical factor in this human-robot interaction is safety and the ability
                of
                the
                mechanism to comply with human intentions. It thus becomes a necessity for the manipulator
                to
                detect
                external disturbances and interactions, and be able to react accordingly. In this research,
                a
                methodology
                for sensor-less full body active compliance is proposed on a 6-DOF RSS
                (Rotary-Spherical-Spherical) parallel
                manipulator. By using the proposed approach, the manipulator can detect and comply with the
                external forces
                on any part of its body without using any explicit force/torque sensor at the joint or the
                end-effector.
                This is done by utilizing the estimated joint torque based on the actuator current feedback
                only. A
                three-layer cascaded impedance controller for active compliance and reaction to various
                human
                interactions
                are reported. The proposed design and unique methodology for compliance exhibits an
                effective
                and
                inexpensive yet reliable alternative to be used in safe human-robot interactions and force
                controlled
                manufacturing applications.

                The optimization of parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) involve several constraints that
                are
                difficult to
                formalize, thus making optimal synthesis problem highly challenging. The presence of passive
                joint limits as
                well as the singularities and self-collisions lead to a complicated relation between the
                input
                and output
                parameters. In this article, a novel optimization methodology is proposed by combining a
                local
                search,
                Nelder–Mead algorithm, with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy distribution
                for
                faster and
                more efficient exploration of the optimization space. The effect of the dimension of the
                optimization
                problem and the different constraints are discussed to highlight the complexities of
                closed-loop
                kinematic
                chain optimization. The work also presents the approaches used to consider constraints for
                passive joint
                boundaries as well as singularities to avoid internal collisions in such mechanisms. The
                proposed algorithm
                can also optimize the length of the prismatic actuators and the constraints can be added in
                modular fashion,
                allowing to understand the impact of given criteria on the final result. The application of
                the
                presented
                approach is used to optimize two PKMs of different degrees of freedom.
