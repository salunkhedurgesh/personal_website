                Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without meeting a
                singularity.
                The name cuspidal was coined based on the existence of a cusp point in the workspace of 3R
                serial robots. The existence of a cusp point was proved to be a necessary and sufficient
                condition for
                orthogonal robots to be cuspidal, but it was not possible to extend this condition to
                non-orthogonal robots. The
                goal of this paper is to prove that this condition stands for any generic 3R serial robot.
                This result would
                give the designer more flexibility. In the presented work, the geometrical interpretation of
                the inverse
                kinematics of 3R robots is revisited and important observations on the nonsingular change of
                posture are
                noted. The paper presents a theorem regarding the existence of reduced aspects in any
                generic 3R serial
                robot. Based on these observations and on this theorem, we prove that the existence of a
                cusp point is a
                necessary and sufficient condition for any 3R generic robot to be cuspidal.

                Cuspidal serial robots can change inverse kinematic solutions (IKS) without crossing
                singularities in the joint space
                because they have multiple IKS in a singularity-free region. This property of robots has
                been
                researched for over three
                decades but has not been taken seriously in consideration while designing new robots. The
                presented work points
                out issues related to nonsingular change of IKS and path planning specific to the cuspidal
                robots that are present in
                existing commercial robots used in various applications. The multiple IKS at the initial
                end-effector pose allows the
                user to choose an initial IKS that may lead to a continuous and repeatable path. We analyze
                in
                detail how the choice
                of the initial IKS affects the feasibility and repeatability of the prescribed path.
                Cuspidal
                robots can be used safely if
                the workspace is analyzed taking into account the cuspidality property. For these reasons,
                we
                propose a methodology
                for path testing and planning that considers different path scenarios. Given the rise of
                unconventional designs in 6R
                robots, the identification of cuspidal properties in the design phase of a robot is of
                paramount
                importance. We recall
                all the known criteria for cuspidality and propose new methods to decide if a given 6R robot
                is
                cuspidal. Accordingly, a
                practical guideline is proposed for deciding the cuspidality of a generic 6R robot.
