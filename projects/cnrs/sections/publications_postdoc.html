                Teaching robots new skills should be as natural as showing rather than programming. Learning from Demonstration (LfD) moves toward this goal by allowing users to guide a robot or sketch a desired motion, enabling learning without writing a line of code. Yet most LfD methods remain tied to the robot they were trained on. Changes in morphology, different link lengths, joint orientations, or limits often break the learned behaviour, making retraining unavoidable. Here we introduce a framework that endows robots with kinematic intelligence: an internal understanding of their own joint limits, singularities, and connectivity. Instead of correcting for these constraints after learning, we embed them directly into the control policy from the outset. The approach takes one or multiple demonstrations, extracts a globally stable dynamical system, and produces behaviours that remain valid across robots with different kinematic structures. Our method is grounded in a comprehensive analytical classification of non-cuspidal 3-revolute (3R) arms, which form the building blocks of many industrial manipulators. This classification enables a joint-space policy that preserves user intent while automatically adapting to robot-specific constraints. We validate the framework on a diverse set of simulated and real robots, redundant and non-redundant, with varied link geometries and joint configurations, and show that the demonstrated skill can be executed safely, smoothly, and consistently on all of them. By showing how analytical kinematic properties can be leveraged for cross-robot skill transfer, our work moves LfD closer to scalable, intuitive robot teaching for non-experts, enabling safe and reliable deployment without retraining.

                Redundant robots, with more degrees of freedom than
                required for a given task, offer enhanced dexterity but can exhibit
                complex kinematic behaviour in motion planning. Cuspidal robots,
                which can change inverse kinematic solutions without crossing singularities, have been reported to pose unique challenges for motion
                feasibility and repeatability. While cuspidality has been extensively
                studied for 3R and certain 6R robots, no formal classification
                exists for redundant architectures. This letter presents a systematic
                framework for classifying 7R wrist-partitioned redundant robots
                based on their cuspidal properties. The method reduces the 7R
                structure to a parameterized 3R equivalent via the redundant joint
                angle, enabling the application of established theory for cuspidal
                robots. Using this approach, commercially available robots are
                analysed and categorized as cuspidal or noncuspidal. Results show
                that the design offsets in commercial cobots may lead to cuspidality,
                which can potentially cause a nonsingular change of operation
                mode in collaborative applications. This classification framework
                provides a foundation for cuspidality-aware path planning and
                offers practical guidelines for designing non-cuspidal redundant
                robots to ensure safer and more predictable operation.

                The kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot has been investigated with multiple approaches in the past.
                The algebraic
                approaches have established concrete results but are unfortunately limited to special classes or
                architectural
                simplifications. Geometric approaches on the other hand have extended the analysis to generic robots
                while also
                providing an intuitive understanding of their kinematic properties. We use the best of both approaches
                to present the
                kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot, using the inverse kinematic model inherited from a method
                based on conformal
                geometric algebra. The paper discusses a generic framework to study the conditions for a 3R robot to
                have four inverse
                kinematic solutions (IKS) and allows to study the distribution of IKS as seen in workspace. The
                necessary and sufficient
                conditions for a class of orthogonal robots are presented using the proposed approach.
