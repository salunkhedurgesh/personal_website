                            A cuspidal serial robot can change inverse kinematic solutions (IKS) without crossing
                            singularities because it has multiple IKS in a singularity-free region. This property of
                            robots has been researched for over thirty years but has not been taken seriously when
                            designing new robots. The presented work points out issues related to nonsingular change of
                            IKS and path planning specific to the cuspidal robots present in existing commercial robots
                            used in various applications. The multiple IKS at the initial end-effector pose allows the
                            user to choose an initial IKS that may lead to a continuous and repeatable path. We analyze
                            in detail how the initial IKS choice affects the prescribed path’s feasibility and
                            repeatability. Cuspidal robots can be used safely if the workspace is analyzed, considering
                            the cuspidality property. For these reasons, we propose a path testing and planning
                            methodology that considers different path scenarios. Given the rise of unconventional
                            designs in 6R robots, the identification of cuspidal properties in the design phase of a
                            robot is of paramount importance. We recall all the known criteria for cuspidality and
                            propose new methods to decide if a given 6R robot is cuspidal. Accordingly, a practical
                            guideline is proposed for deciding the cuspidality of a generic 6R robot.

                            In this paper, I was involved in conceptualization, implementation as well as writing of the
                            article. This work is one of the most significant contributions of my doctoral thesis. I
                            present a complete framework for the path planning of cuspidal robots and an algorithm for
                            deciding the cuspidality of 6R robots. This work analyses thousands of 6R robots and almost
                            all industrial robots for cuspidality. Important kinematic issues, as well as the
                            implication of cuspidality on the path planning of robots, are presented in this work. The
                            work further highlights why cuspidal robots are unsuitable for collaborative tasks thus
                            raising an awareness among robot designers to consider cuspidality in their design
                            considerations while proposing a new robot in the market. This paper is relevant in
                            understanding why I propose leveraging kinematic analysis when transferring tasks among
                            robots.

                            Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without meeting a
                            singularity.
                            The name cuspidal was coined based on the existence of a cusp point in the workspace of 3R
                            serial robots.
                            The existence of a cusp point was proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for
                            orthogonal robots
                            to be cuspidal, but it was not possible to extend this condition to non-orthogonal robots.
                            The
                            goal of this
                            paper is to prove that this condition stands for any generic 3R serial robot. This result
                            would
                            give the
                            designer more flexibility. In the presented work, the geometrical interpretation of the
                            inverse
                            kinematics
                            of 3R robots is revisited and important observations on the nonsingular change of posture
                            are
                            noted. The
                            paper presents a theorem regarding the existence of reduced aspects in any generic 3R serial
                            robot. Based
                            on these observations and on this theorem, we prove that the existence of a cusp point is a
                            necessary and
                            sufficient condition for any 3R generic robot to be cuspidal.

                            In this paper, I was involved in conceptualization, implementation as well as writing of the
                            article. This work was another significant contribution of my doctoral thesis. I proved two
                            theorems of great importance to the theoretical kinematics of serial robots. The first
                            theorem shows that each inverse kinematic solution of the 3R robot lies in distinct reduced
                            aspects. Later, geometric analysis was leveraged to present a necessary and sufficient
                            condition for a generic 3R robot to be cuspidal. Both these theorems were previously proved
                            only for orthogonal robots, and no results existed on the cuspidality of generic 3R robots.
                            This paper highlights my ability to identify, analyze and solve the challenges relevant to
                            kinematics.

                            The optimization of parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) involve several constraints that
                            are
                            difficult to
                            formalize, thus making optimal synthesis problem highly challenging. The presence of passive
                            joint limits as
                            well as the singularities and self-collisions lead to a complicated relation between the
                            input
                            and output
                            parameters. In this article, a novel optimization methodology is proposed by combining a
                            local
                            search,
                            Nelder–Mead algorithm, with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy distribution
                            for
                            faster and
                            more efficient exploration of the optimization space. The effect of the dimension of the
                            optimization
                            problem and the different constraints are discussed to highlight the complexities of
                            closed-loop
                            kinematic
                            chain optimization. The work also presents the approaches used to consider constraints for
                            passive joint
                            boundaries as well as singularities to avoid internal collisions in such mechanisms. The
                            proposed algorithm
                            can also optimize the length of the prismatic actuators and the constraints can be added in
                            modular fashion,
                            allowing to understand the impact of given criteria on the final result. The application of
                            the
                            presented
                            approach is used to optimize two PKMs of different degrees of freedom.

                            In this paper, I was involved in conceptualization, implementation as well as writing of the
                            article. This work is another important contribution towards optimal kinematic design of
                            parallel robots. I was able to show why the Nelder-Mead method’s geometric search of the
                            parameter space is efficient and relevant to mechanism design optimization. The algorithm
                            combined local and global strategies to quickly scan and refine the optimized result. The
                            presented algorithm is especially advantageous when multiple parallel robots are to be
                            optimized in a hybrid series-parallel robotic system. This paper highlights my ability to
                            understand a problem thoroughly and develop novel methods required for efficient solutions.

                            A cuspidal serial robot can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without
                            crossing a
                            singularity. Cuspidal robots ask for extra care and caution in trajectory planning, as
                            identifying an aspect
                            related to one unique inverse kinematic solution is not possible. The issues related to
                            motion
                            planning with
                            cuspidal robots are related to the inherent property arising from the geometric design of
                            the
                            robot. The
                            cuspidality property has not been considered in recent industrial 6R robots with a
                            non-spherical
                            wrist. In
                            this work, cuspidality is illustrated with the JACO robot (gen 2, non-spherical wrist), a
                            serial
                            arm by
                            Kinova Robotics which is deployed in various applications and is cuspidal in nature. A
                            nonsingular change
                            of solutions for the robot is provided to highlight the effect of cuspidal robots on the
                            interference with
                            the environment. The pose with multiple inverse kinematic solutions in an aspect is
                            presented.
                            Problems in choosing the initial solution of the path in cuspidal robots, and its
                            consequence,
                            is
                            illustrated with an example path in the workspace of the JACO robot. The paper presents the
                            importance of
                            cuspidality analysis of 6R robots and the implications of neglecting it.

                            In this paper, I was involved in conceptualization, implementation as well as writing of the
                            article. This work is of special importance as it addresses a very practical and serious
                            issue about commercial cuspidal robots. It was reported previously that unexpected issues
                            occurred while planning a trajectory for the Kinova Jaco Gen2 robot. This work analyzed the
                            robot for cuspidality by studying joint space and workspace singularities. This paper
                            highlights my ability to identify, analyze, and solve existing challenges in existing
                            robots.

                            Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution (IKS) to another without
                            meeting
                            a
                            singularity. This property can be analyzed by understanding the inverse kinematic model
                            (IKM) as
                            well as the
                            singularities in the joint space and in the workspace. In this article, we revisit the
                            geometrical
                            interpretation of the IKM with conics. The conditions of getting different conics and their
                            implication on
                            singularities are discussed and the observations regarding the nature of the conics are
                            presented. Further,
                            a sufficient condition for a 3R robot to be binary (i.e. with up to 2 IKS) as well as
                            quaternary
                            (i.e. with
                            up to 4 IKS) is put forth by analyzing the geometrical interpretation of the IKM. The
                            possibility to derive
                            a necessary and sufficient condition is presented too.

                            difficult results through algebraic analysis. This paper highlights my ability to identify

                            Cuspidal robots are robots with at least two inverse kinematic solutions that can be
                            connected
                            by a
                            singularity-free path. Deciding the cuspidality of generic 3R robots has been studied in the
                            past, but
                            extending the study to six-degree-of-freedom robots can be a challenging problem. Many
                            robots
                            can be modeled
                            as a polynomial map together with a real algebraic set so that the notion of cuspidality can
                            be
                            extended to
                            these data. In this paper we design an algorithm that, on input a polynomial map in n
                            indeterminates, and s
                            polynomials in the same indeterminates describing a real algebraic set of dimension d,
                            decides
                            the
                            cuspidality of the restriction of the map to the real algebraic set under consideration.
                            Moreover, if D and
                            <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> are, respectively the
                            maximum
                            degree and the
                            bound on the bit size of the coefficients of the input polynomials, this algorithm runs in
                            time
                            log-linear
                            in <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> and polynomial in
                            ((s+d)D)O(n2). It
                            relies on many high-level algorithms in computer algebra which use advanced methods on real
                            algebraic sets
                            and critical loci of polynomial maps. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm that
                            tackles the
                            cuspidality problem from a general point of view.

                            As a co-author, I was involved in conceptualizing the idea, kinematic part of identification
                            and writing of the article. This paper is submitted mainly to highlight how algebraic
                            analysis of a robot can provide global kinematic properties with certainty. In this paper,
                            three sophisticated algorithms from real algebraic geometry and projective algebraic
                            geometry were used to develop certified methods to determine cuspidality in nR nonredundant
                            robots. This paper highlights my capabilities in using algebraic tools too. This makes me
                            versatile and allows me to approach a technical challenge through different directions
                            complementing advantages of different mathematical approaches.

                            Parallel manipulators are being used extensively to cater to the needs of a multitude of
                            industrial
                            automation applications. Due to its kinematic accuracy and structural stiffness, parallel
                            manipulators have
                            proven considerable advantage over their serial counterparts. In modern applications, humans
                            train,
                            collaborate and interact with the manipulators in order to maximize the productivity and the
                            quality of the
                            final product. The critical factor in this human-robot interaction is safety and the ability
                            of
                            the
                            mechanism to comply with human intentions. It thus becomes a necessity for the manipulator
                            to
                            detect
                            external disturbances and interactions, and be able to react accordingly. In this research,
                            a
                            methodology
                            for sensor-less full body active compliance is proposed on a 6-DOF RSS
                            (Rotary-Spherical-Spherical) parallel
                            manipulator. By using the proposed approach, the manipulator can detect and comply with the
                            external forces
                            on any part of its body without using any explicit force/torque sensor at the joint or the
                            end-effector.
                            This is done by utilizing the estimated joint torque based on the actuator current feedback
                            only. A
                            three-layer cascaded impedance controller for active compliance and reaction to various
                            human
                            interactions
                            are reported. The proposed design and unique methodology for compliance exhibits an
                            effective
                            and
                            inexpensive yet reliable alternative to be used in safe human-robot interactions and force
                            controlled
                            manufacturing applications.

                            In this paper, the first and second author had an equal contribution to the research. In
                            this paper, I was involved in conceptualization, implementation as well as writing of the
                            article. I was responsible for the kinematic analysis, design and manufacturing of the 6-RSS
                            parallel platform.

                            This work is submitted to show that I am interested in and capable of researching different
                            fields of robotics. This work investigated parallel robots' dynamics, control, and force
                            compliance, which is an entirely different field from my doctoral thesis. This work also
                            involved implementation issues as we designed and manufactured the robot in-house. This
                            highlights my ability to work on real-world robotic systems and emphasizes my acumen in both
                            the theoretical and practical sides of robotics. Furthermore, this work was presented in
                            context with human-robot interaction which is a possible field of application of the work
                            presented in my research proposal.
