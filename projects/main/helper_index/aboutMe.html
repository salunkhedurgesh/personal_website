<p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/" target="_blank"
        class="ls2n">LASA</a> lab, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank" class="ls2n">EPFL</a>,
    working with <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/aude.billard" target="_blank" class="ls2n">Prof. Aude
    Billard</a>. My research spans kinematic intelligence for safe and explainable robot learning, transfer
    learning with sub-domain guarantees, Conformal Geometric Algebra for kinematic analysis, and the design of
    mechanically intelligent robots, including tensegrity-inspired joints and rolling-kinematics platforms.

    <br><br>

    I completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.ls2n.fr/" target="_blank" class="ls2n">LS2N</a>, Nantes, on
    &ldquo;<a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04520763" target="_blank" class="ls2n">Cuspidal Robots:
    theoretical study, classification and applications to commercial robots</a>&rdquo; under
    Prof. Philippe Wenger and Prof. Damien Chablat. My doctoral work established systematic frameworks for
    classifying cuspidal robots and their implications for motion planning in commercial cobots.

    I hold a double Master&rsquo;s degree from the Erasmus Mundus <a href="https://jemaro.ec-nantes.fr/"
        target="_blank" class="ls2n">EMARO+</a> program, with a
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344289581_Optimal_kinematic_design_of_parallel_mechanism_for_otological_surgery"
        target="_blank" class="ls2n">thesis</a> on the optimal kinematic design of a parallel mechanism for
    otological surgery, conducted with CHU Nantes, DFKI Germany, and UNIGE Genoa.

    <br><br>

    I actively contribute to the kinematics research community,  currently preparing course material for
    <a href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/education/ras-university" target="_blank" class="ls2n">IEEE RAS
    University</a> and a kinematics-grounded robot motion planning course at EPFL.

    I strongly believe in,

    <span style="color: rgba(120, 200, 190, 0.88); font-style: italic;">
        &ldquo;Progress in robotics will come from a principled fusion of learning methods with analytical methods. The future belongs to co-designed robots that are mechanically
        intelligent by design and autonomously adaptive by learning.&rdquo;
