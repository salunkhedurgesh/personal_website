    I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/" target="_blank"
        class="ls2n">LASA</a>
    lab, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/" target="_blank" class="ls2n">EPFL</a>, where I explore how kinematic theory
    can
    enhance robot learning, motion generalization, and transfer across platforms. I completed my PhD at
    <a href="https://www.ls2n.fr/" target="_blank" class="ls2n">LS2N</a>
    lab on "<a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04520763" target="_blank" class="ls2n">Cuspidal
        Robots: theoretical study, classification and
        applications to commercial robots</a>" under the supervision of Prof. Philippe Wenger and
    Prof. Damien Chablat. My doctoral research addressed the fundamental kinematic properties of cuspidal robots and
    their
    role in singularity-free transitions between inverse kinematic solutions.

    I hold a double Master’s degree from the Erasmus Mundus program, European Master on Advanced Robotics plus (<a
        href="https://jemaro.ec-nantes.fr/" target="_blank">EMARO+</a>),
    with a <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344289581_Optimal_kinematic_design_of_parallel_mechanism_for_otological_surgery"
        target="_blank" class="ls2n">master
        thesis</a>
    on the optimal kinematic design of a parallel mechanism for otological surgery, carried out in collaboration with
    CHU Nantes, DFKI Germany, and UNIGE Genoa.

    Earlier in my career, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur,
    where I
    contributed to research in sensorless compliance control of 6-DoF parallel manipulators and multi-agent cooperative
    manipulation. Prior to that, I was a mechanical design engineer at GreyOrange Pvt. Ltd., a leading warehouse
    automation
    company in India, where I worked on industrial robotic solutions.
