Cuspidal robots, which can change inverse kinematic solutions without crossing singularities, have been reported to pose unique challenges for motion feasibility and repeatability. While cuspidality has been extensively studied for 3R and certain 6R robots, no formal classification exists for redundant architectures. This letter presents a systematic framework for classifying 7R wrist-partitioned redundant robots based on their cuspidal properties. The method reduces the 7R structure to a parameterized 3R equivalent via the redundant joint angle, enabling the application of established theory for cuspidal robots. Using this approach, commercially available robots are analysed and categorized as cuspidal or noncuspidal. Results show that the design offsets in commercial cobots may lead to cuspidality, which can potentially cause a nonsingular change of operation mode in collaborative applications. This classification framework provides a foundation for cuspidality-aware path planning and offers practical guidelines for designing non-cuspidal redundant robots to ensure safer and more predictable operation.",

A rigorous kinematic analysis reveals that the mechanism exhibits a unique reflective symmetry and that its full-cycle mobility is theoretically equivalent to pure rolling between identical elliptical cones. This insight enables an unconstrained single-parameter description of the joint's motion that extends the inherent symmetry of the mechanism to the mathematical analysis also. Such a description provides a compact and efficient kinematic and static model for the spherical X-joint. Furthermore, a remote actuation strategy based on antagonistic cables is proposed, and it is analytically proven that the joint exhibits positive coactivation across its workspace. These findings demonstrate the spherical X-joint's strong potential for remote actuation applications, particularly in the design of lightweight, bio-inspired robotic wrists and manipulators.",

Geometric approaches on the other hand have extended the analysis to generic robots while also providing an intuitive understanding of their kinematic properties. We use the best of both approaches to present the kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot, using the inverse kinematic model inherited from a method based on conformal geometric algebra. The paper discusses a generic framework to study the conditions for a 3R robot to have four inverse kinematic solutions (IKS) and allows to study the distribution of IKS as seen in workspace. The necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of orthogonal robots are presented using the proposed approach.",

This property of robots has been researched for over three decades but has not been taken seriously in consideration while designing new robots. The presented work points out issues related to nonsingular change of IKS and path planning specific to the cuspidal robots that are present in existing commercial robots used in various applications. The multiple IKS at the initial end-effector pose allows the user to choose an initial IKS that may lead to a continuous and repeatable path. We analyze in detail how the choice of the initial IKS affects the feasibility and repeatability of the prescribed path. Cuspidal robots can be used safely if the workspace is analyzed taking into account the cuspidality property. For these reasons, we propose a methodology for path testing and planning that considers different path scenarios. Given the rise of unconventional designs in 6R robots, the identification of cuspidal properties in the design phase of a robot is of paramount importance. We recall all the known criteria for cuspidality and propose new methods to decide if a given 6R robot is cuspidal. Accordingly, a practical guideline is proposed for deciding the cuspidality of a generic 6R robot.",

This necessitates optimal trajectory planning, respecting the dynamics and technical limits of the particular robot. In this paper, a method for singularity-free time-optimal point-to-point trajectory (PtP) trajectory planning is proposed.

Cuspidal robots ask for extra care and caution in trajectory planning, as identifying an aspect related to one unique inverse kinematic solution is not possible. The issues related to motion planning with cuspidal robots are related to the inherent property arising from the geometric design of the robot. The cuspidality property has not been considered in recent industrial 6R robots with a non-spherical wrist. In this work, cuspidality is illustrated with the JACO robot (gen 2, non-spherical wrist), a serial arm by Kinova Robotics which is deployed in various applications and is cuspidal in nature. A nonsingular change of solutions for the robot is provided to highlight the effect of cuspidal robots on the interference with the environment. The pose with multiple inverse kinematic solutions in an aspect is presented. Problems in choosing the initial solution of the path in cuspidal robots, and its consequence, is illustrated with an example path in the workspace of the JACO robot.

Deciding the cuspidality of generic 3R robots has been studied in the past, but extending the study to six-degree-of-freedom robots can be a challenging problem. Many robots can be modeled as a polynomial map together with a real algebraic set so that the notion of cuspidality can be extended to these data. In this paper we design an algorithm that, on input a polynomial map in n indeterminates, and s polynomials in the same indeterminates describing a real algebraic set of dimension d, decides the cuspidality of the restriction of the map to the real algebraic set under consideration. Moreover, if D and τ are, respectively the maximum degree and the bound on the bit size of the coefficients of the input polynomials, this algorithm runs in time log-linear in τ and polynomial in ((s+d)D)O(n²). It relies on many high-level algorithms in computer algebra which use advanced methods on real algebraic sets and critical loci of polynomial maps. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm that tackles the cuspidality problem from a general point of view.",

The conditions of getting different conics and their implication on singularities are discussed and the observations regarding the nature of the conics are presented. Further, a sufficient condition for a 3R robot to be binary (i.e. with up to 2 IKS) as well as quaternary (i.e. with up to 4 IKS) is put forth by analyzing the geometrical interpretation of the IKM.

The existence of a cusp point was proved to be a necessary and sufficient condition for orthogonal robots to be cuspidal, but it was not possible to extend this condition to non-orthogonal robots. The goal of this paper is to prove that this condition stands for any generic 3R serial robot. This result would give the designer more flexibility. In the presented work, the geometrical interpretation of the inverse kinematics of 3R robots is revisited and important observations on the nonsingular change of posture are noted. The paper presents a theorem regarding the existence of reduced aspects in any generic 3R serial robot.

In this article, a novel optimization methodology is proposed by combining a local search, Nelder-Mead algorithm, with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy distribution for faster and more efficient exploration of the optimization space. The effect of the dimension of the optimization problem and the different constraints are discussed to highlight the complexities of closed-loop kinematic chain optimization. The work also presents the approaches used to consider constraints for passive joint boundaries as well as singularities to avoid internal collisions in such mechanisms. The proposed algorithm can also optimize the length of the prismatic actuators and the constraints can be added in modular fashion, allowing to understand the impact of given criteria on the final result.

Due to its kinematic accuracy and structural stiffness, parallel manipulators have proven considerable advantage over their serial counterparts. In modern applications, humans train, collaborate and interact with the manipulators in order to maximize the productivity and the quality of the final product. The critical factor in this human-robot interaction is safety and the ability of the mechanism to comply with human intentions. It thus becomes a necessity for the manipulator to detect external disturbances and interactions, and be able to react accordingly. In this research, a methodology for sensor-less full body active compliance is proposed on a 6-DOF RSS (Rotary-Spherical-Spherical) parallel manipulator. By using the proposed approach, the manipulator can detect and comply with the external forces on any part of its body without using any explicit force/torque sensor at the joint or the end-effector. This is done by utilizing the estimated joint torque based on the actuator current feedback only. A three-layer cascaded impedance controller for active compliance and reaction to various human interactions are reported. The proposed design and unique methodology for compliance exhibits an effective and inexpensive yet reliable alternative to be used in safe human-robot interactions and force controlled manufacturing applications.",
