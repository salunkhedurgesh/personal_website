                Redundant robots, with more degrees of freedom than required for a given task, offer enhanced dexterity but can exhibit complex kinematic behaviour in motion planning. Cuspidal robots, which can change inverse kinematic solutions without crossing singularities, have been reported to pose unique challenges for motion feasibility and repeatability. While cuspidality has been extensively studied for 3R and certain 6R robots, no formal classification exists for redundant architectures. This letter presents a systematic framework for classifying 7R wrist-partitioned redundant robots based on their cuspidal properties. The method reduces the 7R structure to a parameterized 3R equivalent via the redundant joint angle, enabling the application of established theory for cuspidal robots. Using this approach, commercially available robots are analysed and categorized as cuspidal or noncuspidal. Results show that the design offsets in commercial cobots may lead to cuspidality, which can potentially cause a nonsingular change of operation mode in collaborative applications. This classification framework provides a foundation for cuspidality-aware path planning and offers practical guidelines for designing non-cuspidal redundant robots to ensure safer and more predictable operation.

                This work presents the spherical X-joint, a novel 4R spherical linkage featuring two pairs of identical links arranged in a crossed configuration.
                A rigorous kinematic analysis reveals that the mechanism exhibits a unique reflective symmetry and that its full-cycle mobility is theoretically equivalent to pure rolling between identical elliptical cones. This insight enables \rev{an unconstrained} single-parameter description of the joint’s motion that extends the inherent symmetry of the mechanism to the mathematical analysis also. Such a description provides a compact and efficient kinematic and static model for the spherical X-joint.
                Furthermore, a remote actuation strategy based on antagonistic cables is proposed, and it is analytically proven that the joint exhibits positive coactivation across its workspace. These findings demonstrate the spherical X-joint's strong potential for remote actuation applications, particularly in the design of lightweight, bio-inspired robotic wrists and manipulators.

                The kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot has been investigated with multiple approaches in the past.
                The algebraic
                approaches have established concrete results but are unfortunately limited to special classes or
                architectural
                simplifications. Geometric approaches on the other hand have extended the analysis to generic robots
                while also
                providing an intuitive understanding of their kinematic properties. We use the best of both approaches
                to present the
                kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot, using the inverse kinematic model inherited from a method
                based on conformal
                geometric algebra. The paper discusses a generic framework to study the conditions for a 3R robot to
                have four inverse
                kinematic solutions (IKS) and allows to study the distribution of IKS as seen in workspace. The
                necessary and sufficient
                conditions for a class of orthogonal robots are presented using the proposed approach.

                The inverse kinematics of generic 3R robots has been investigated through multiple approaches, mainly
                algebraic methods
                involving the solution of certain equation sets. Previous geometric interpretations of the solution,
                characterized as
                the intersection of a pair of conics have been confined to the joint-space domain. In this article, we
                study the Inverse
                Kinematic Model (IKM) of 3R robots, using the advantages of Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to provide
                further
                insights on its kinematic properties. Our approach directly yields a univariate polynomial in terms of
                $\theta_2$
                without the need to eliminate $\theta_1$ and $\theta_3$ by reframing the problem as the intersection of
                two circles,
                which are fundamental elements within this algebraic framework.
