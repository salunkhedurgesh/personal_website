                The kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot has been investigated with multiple approaches in the past.
                The algebraic
                approaches have established concrete results but are unfortunately limited to special classes or
                architectural
                simplifications. Geometric approaches on the other hand have extended the analysis to generic robots
                while also
                providing an intuitive understanding of their kinematic properties. We use the best of both approaches
                to present the
                kinematic analysis of a generic 3R robot, using the inverse kinematic model inherited from a method
                based on conformal
                geometric algebra. The paper discusses a generic framework to study the conditions for a 3R robot to
                have four inverse
                kinematic solutions (IKS) and allows to study the distribution of IKS as seen in workspace. The
                necessary and sufficient
                conditions for a class of orthogonal robots are presented using the proposed approach.

                The inverse kinematics of generic 3R robots has been investigated through multiple approaches, mainly
                algebraic methods
                involving the solution of certain equation sets. Previous geometric interpretations of the solution,
                characterized as
                the intersection of a pair of conics have been confined to the joint-space domain. In this article, we
                study the Inverse
                Kinematic Model (IKM) of 3R robots, using the advantages of Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to provide
                further
                insights on its kinematic properties. Our approach directly yields a univariate polynomial in terms of
                $\theta_2$
                without the need to eliminate $\theta_1$ and $\theta_3$ by reframing the problem as the intersection of
                two circles,
                which are fundamental elements within this algebraic framework.
