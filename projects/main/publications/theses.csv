thesis23_salunkhe,"Cuspidal robots: theoretical study, classification, and application to commercial robots","Durgesh Haribhau Salunkhe","Ecole Centrale de Nantes, LS2N, CNRS",PhD Thesis,2024,,,/projects/main/resources/citations/thesis23_salunkhe.bib,/projects/main/resources/papers/thesis23_salunkhe.pdf,,"Cuspidal robots are robots that have at least one connected region with multiple inverse kinematic solutions. This allows cuspidal robots to change solutions without crossing singularities. This doctoral thesis presents theoretical study on cuspidal analysis of 3R serial robots, identification algorithms for generic 6R robots, and trajectory planning implications for commercial cuspidal robots.","Advisors: Philippe Wenger and Damien Chablat"
