abstract = {Endoscopic surgery of the ear and sinuses promotes minimally invasive approaches and allows visualization of hard-to-reach areas. However, these procedures can be challenging because they require the surgeon to hold the endoscope, thereby immobilizing one hand. Therefore, designing an assistive robot for this type of endoscopic surgery should improve ergonomics for the surgeon and enhance patient outcomes. To precisely define the specifications of such a robot, it is essential to study the anatomical regions of the ear and sinuses. This involves creating a geometric atlas based on CT scans to determine the dimensions and variations of these robotic workspaces. Additionally, considering the needs of surgeons is a critical part of this study. The design phase of the robot begins with an analysis of various architectural choices, focusing on variations of a mechanism with an offset center of rotation. This mechanism combines a 2-DOF spherical mechanism with a double parallelogram. Finally, the modalities for controlling this robot via image tracking are defined using an algorithm that employs CamShift.}
